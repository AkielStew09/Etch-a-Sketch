# Etch-a-Sketch

This Etch-a-Sketch is an exercise to show off as well as improve DOM manipulation skills. Based on
the description, it seems like it will consist of setting up a grid of squares, and using them in 
some way to make drawing-like designs. I'm excited to give this a try, although I am kind of 
trying to move past front end studying quickly so I can get into more full stack technologies.
Let's see.
